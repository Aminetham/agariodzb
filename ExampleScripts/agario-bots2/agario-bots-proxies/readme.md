Fork this repo:

https://github.com/jimboy3100/jimboy3100.github.io/raw/master/ExampleScripts/agario-bots2/agario-bots-proxies/Gather_Proxy_9.0_Premium.zip

The above program is for replacing proxies.txt
USE ALWAYS VPN AND CONNECT ONLY TO SOCK5 SOCKETS (SAFEST)
YOU ARE NOT SAFE IF USING SOCKETS AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS THING WORKS
YOU USE THIS PROGRAM ON YOUR OWN RISK, THEY TOLD ME IT IS DANGEROUS

On Gather Proxy -> Proxy Checker -> Choose only SOCK5 (it takes 30 min)
Export least 1000 ALIVE proxies, see the generated file and replace everything on proxies.txt after # SOCKS5

### GOOD LUCK!
