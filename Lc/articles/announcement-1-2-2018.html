		<p><strong>Announcement to all Players of ℄ Legend clan:</strong><br><strong>1.</strong> All players of ℄ wear our symbol, we have no friends. ℄? for candidates, ℄? Senpai, ℄? Members. <br>Senpai rule means not playing with any randoms at all, avoid candidates and ✵ΕΛ✵ servers . Avoid wearing ? the symbol if not playing in skype call on Senpai room. If anyones wants to play with old friends, choose another name and server. ✵ΕΛ✵ are allies, for any issues talk to ✵ΕΛ✵ admins Katerina G92 or Ringo from Candidates room.<br><strong>2.</strong> People from candidates are selected by time to become Members or Senpai. Talk to admin Hany for Candidate issues, to admin Dabous for Member issues and to Machouil (Polska) for Senpai issues.<br><strong>3.</strong> USE <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.legendmod.ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.legendmod.ml</a></span>&nbsp;LEGEND MOD and tag/password. This is very important. Choose a template to make it look as you like. Don't feed much and don't trust people who don't use LM and password properly.<br><strong>4</strong>. On our website <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.lclan.ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.lclan.ml</a></span> Video section, there are videos about tricksplits, popslits, reversed tricksplits, fake tricksplits and other splits. Look at the articles and find a player with who you play better (℄ couples). <br><strong>5.</strong> Don't attack real ℄ players, rather inform the specific admins for issues. Clan is based on fairness, strategy, and to our heroes.<br><strong>6.</strong> Candidates are allowed to play with randoms, only if they keep them VERY SMALL, mass needs to go to clan. If random makes mistakes, it is Lc player who will be blamed for. If random becomes big or eats Lc, eat him on 1st chance. Senpai rules avoid any such playing with any randoms.<br><strong>7.</strong> INSULTS of any kind are not allowed.<br><strong>8.</strong> Candidates or Member or Senpai room game is not better one another, it is just the rules that are different. E.g For clan wars with multiclans Lc Candidates with ✵ΕΛ✵ allies can win more efficiently.<br><strong>9.</strong> Avoid savaging the enemy. Give them time and space to grow to provide us equal wars depened on game skills. If many ℄ on a server that are not needed, send another server. We already know that we are the best and biggest clan of FFA agario.<br><strong>10.</strong> If you are not active, or not wearing ℄ symbol, leave our rooms.<br><strong>11.</strong> Decisions are made under vote of admins.<br><strong>12.</strong> For skype calls, don't click button call, rather type command /golive (it makes no ring and it is not annoying). It is suggested to DISABLE skype room notifications (skype makes too much noise otherwise, click on room icon and click disable notifications)<br><strong>13.</strong> Bring your friends in Lc, inform any admin to add them in interview room. This way your friends will learn Pro playing and clan will continue to prosper. Use your skype id or ℄SKP Lc FFA as game name to recruit a player.</p>
<p>Clan belongs to those people who believe in it. Help/teach your teammate as much you would wanted to be helped too. We are the people, we are Legend and we proved that good people can do great things when they are united and organised.</p>
