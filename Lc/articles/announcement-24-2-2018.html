		<p><strong>Announcement to all Players of ℄ Legend clan (issue: loyalty):</strong><br>Lc clan is alive thanks to people who believed in it, and those people are the heroes of Lc. <br>Members and admins are doing a hard job, preparing the players to become pro, active and strategic. We spend time, we teach, we dispute issues, and we love it.<br>Legend clan has strong players, but in fact is an organisation that builds players. We are like a "family", we like to share, to help and to be helped.<br>All players of ℄ wear our symbol, we have no friends. ℄? for candidates (new people and open clan players, the big and main room, fights with many people, the school), ℄? Senpai (pros, who use sctrict no random policy, skype calls, LM), ℄? Members (Old, loyal and trustful). <br>These are different rooms.<br>The most important thing for us is the loyalty. See the rules from www.lclan.ml , refer issues to admins and dont leave rooms. Don't bring back people who left rooms but refer to admins.<br>Legend clan candidates room was the school for many players. But leaving a rooms means for us that the player is unthankful for what we did for him. Most players who left, firstly said "Lc are friends, Lc are noobs, etc". In fact it is their arrogance of leaving, because Lc Senpai players are more skilled than any of those. Soon enough they understand that Lc has no friends, and they blame Lc for their own mistakes. The great majority of those, stop the game.<br>If you feel Lc: <strong>DO NOT LEAVE LC ROOMS FOR ANY REASON</strong>, fight for the greater good of Lc.<br>If you dont feel Lc, or are innactive, or prefer to playing with other friends, or are about to leave:<strong> DO NOT SPEND YOUR TIME, LEAVE LC ROOM</strong>.<br>Those who left we dont want them back. It is a priviledge to be Lc.<br>Clan belongs to each one of us to believe in it. Clan goes first, and we are 1!</p>
<p>*ps There will be a last change for these 5,6 people who left to be disputed for their return. After this, we will close the door to people who traitored us on the first place.</p>
<p><em>By the Council of Lc: Jimboy, Hano, Polska, Lola, Memoriam, Dabous</em></p> 	</div>
