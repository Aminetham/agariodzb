		<p>Strategic announcement to All Lc players:</p>
<p>The basics:<br>To invite a friend in Lc as candidate you should ask from one Lc admin for approval.<br>Lc accepts only Candidates. EA are allies, EA admins are in our candidates room for any issues.<br>Clan goes first! ALWAYS SUPPORT LC OVER ANY FRIEND! Mass belongs to clan! Avoid giving mass to friends rather than clan. If even 1 player distributes mass to randoms, team work goes away. Never support this. EA clan is family, feel free to play freely. If random keeps much clan mass or distributes to 3rd person feel free to attack him. Clan will not force you to eat your random friend, but suggest you to avoid randoms. If a Lc player eats random friend, it is not an Issue of clan. Randoms caused us too much troubles already. If randoms want to be fairly used, they should join Lc and follow specific rules like all we do. Never eat Lc even if eaten, if you know he is not fake. Refer the issue to admin Hany or Contra to dispute player.<br>All must use Legend mod and password fluently, feel free to make your own templates on mod. Avoid giving much mass to people who you dont see in chat.<br>Clan wars:<br>On serious wars that issues comes to prestige, prefer giving the more mass to more experienced (Lc or EA). Small must be the splitters, must split enemy as much as possible to make them ANTI. Use special buttons, watch the videos from our website www.legendclan.ml . Use freely skype command /golive to candidates room for voice communication. Try to learn from the battle and to improve as possible.<br>Fair play:<br>This is suggested, not a rule. Try to play mainly vs clans or the difficult servers of Europe. If many people, and we dominate the one, then bring players to Ither regions (Turkey, Russia...). Try not to savage, not to split 16 to eat the very small opponent of enemy clan. Offer the opponent clan player the chance to play against you. Respect the enemy and try not to insult. <br>Conclusion:<br>On our website there is much to read. Lc belongs to those who blieve in Lc. Lc goes first, it is the way of supporting real friends aginst other friends or enemies. Being good to all means nothing, being good to the family means much. Lc has the its heroes, the Lc people who never traitored us even on the most severe situations. We owe Lc players our prosperity. We are strong, united and friends.</p> 	</div>
