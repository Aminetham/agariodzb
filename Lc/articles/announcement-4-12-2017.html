		<p><strong>Announcement to all Lc players:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Innactives:</strong> <br>Although spamming is not good, but we need players to say a "hi" sometimes on group.<br>We have to remove some "rarely playing" players due to long time absence.</p>
<p><strong>Candidates:</strong> <br>Candidates are players who we build in order to make them efficient players, those who will be on exclusive members room.<br>This needs "long" time, when time passes and they seem loyal to clan and have skills of good gaming, not playing with randoms, proper use of Legend Mod, voice chats, etc</p>
<p><strong>Efficient Candidates:</strong> <br>We are not willing to keep the candidates who do not meet the standard of our clan. Those who don't will to be Pros. But we will never leave or remove a player who really believes in our family. He is more important than XP for us, Lc belong to it's heroes.</p>
<p><strong>Randoms:</strong> <br><strong>[HOT TOPIC]</strong>: Please, if you want to play with randoms, play on another server. <strong>DO NOT PLAY WITH RANDOM IN FRONT OF LC! A PLAYER WHO WILL DO THAT WILL/CAN BE EATEN</strong>.<br>We all know what friends mean. It is bad to traitor a friend, BUT randoms will definitely cause problems. We also do not TRUST the way of playing of randoms. If Random want to be pro, he must be Lc.<br>Due to random friends, change your name on game if it helps, do not protect food/random/friends from Lc.<br>â„„? means Lc will eat EVERYONE or another Lc who plays with randoms (Ofcourse when coming back, he/she owes to give mass back to Lc)</p>
<p><strong>Recruiting:</strong> <br>Help us to prosper, help friends to become organized and pro, you must talk to an admin before inviting any player in Lc.</p>
