		<p>Announcement to All Lc players: LC WILL NOT HAVE RANDOM FRIENDS ANYMORE</p>
<p>Lc Admins and EA clan both agreed on not playing with random friends anymore.This is an enormous change and we considered much about it.<br>How to do it: If you cannot attack your Game friends, change name (Or at least dont feed them). There are 2 occasions: <br>1) Lc is on clan war: Everyone should join Lc with symbol and password. No friends accepted, Lc, EA players feeding randoms (friends) will be eaten too.</p>
<p>Players must have specialties (spliters, helpers, mass keepers)<br>2) Lc on random servers: If none Lc on server a player may team with a random. But since Lc comes, Clan goes first. If player continuously gives mass to randoms rather than Lc he will be eaten.</p>
<p>We can train for all specialties there. Also we may all find a Lc couple, the player we play better with and practice.<br>The reasons for this change: We must push forward on more pro playing. We cannot trust the XP of others or the friends of friends. Also game servers were getting kindegarden because there was no enemy.</p>
<p>This way we will gain more pro playing players, although some players who will not understand may leave. For more info ask Admin Contra, for problem with player refer to Admin Hano any issues.<br>â„„? symbol means player who kills everyone than are not Lc, EA.<br> If anyone wants to be organised game friend he must join Lc (respect rules), and have the same allies and enemies. Good to all means... less XP player</p>
