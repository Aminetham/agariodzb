<p style="font-weight: 400;">7/2/2017 - Due to lack of communication to ℄ and ✵ΕΛ✵, past ally clan to us, is not neutral.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This means we avoid their servers, old friends are allowed to play on same servers, but there can be regional wars too, thus teaming or making war is not considered an issue of&nbsp;℄. What is important, is that in one&nbsp;℄ player sees another&nbsp;℄ player been eaten, he is obliged to support&nbsp;℄ with all causes. This issue will be highly disputed and examined because it is clan that goes first.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">*We need to mention that&nbsp;✵ΕΛ✵ have supported us in all major clan fights in past, as we also did to them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">**We highly suggest and inform&nbsp;players not to insult any clan or players.</p>
