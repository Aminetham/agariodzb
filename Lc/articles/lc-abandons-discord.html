<p><strong>Legend Clan closes its Discord server:</strong></p>
<p>For 14 months Lc occasionally tried to migrate to Discord app from skype because of its extra utilities.</p>
<p>Discord has many&nbsp;disadvantages, such as asking for mobile numbers, and automated system reffered&nbsp;as invalid the valid phone number for existed users, in order to continue using it. Also the were many complaints of people's accounts being disabled and company never replied any message. Other negative sides of Discord are the various useless bots, annoying notifications, invitation and role bugs.</p>
<p>We also noticed that Discord clans of agario are "loose" clans. Discord encourages every user to make his own room by default, with no erase it. There are many invitations of groups messing up games, the great majority of users on servers are inactive (90%), and the great majority of clans are idle, inactive, expired.</p>
<p>Skype offers us a stable and trustworthy communication system with no useless utilities, compatibility and no disabled accounts. <em>Legend clan continues the old ways</em></p>
