<p>18/12/2017 Announcement of the room Senpai (the elite of the elite)</p>
<p>℄? Senpai is a new room of the active most pro players of Lc who also wish not to kill everyone, and avoid Lc-EA servers.</p>
<p>Administrator of Senpai: Machouil (℄?Polska)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason we make this room is the fact many pro players don't like to play with mediums. Players playing with randoms or not experienced cannot play with these rules.</p>
<p>Ofcourse because of the less people when room is inactive players can play as they wish. We will officially settle battles here.</p>
<p>It is good to leave other servers when we have battles because this room will provide better gaming.<br>Savaging is not allowed here, in fact rule is to feed enemy when they are small and let them space to have great fights against you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We welcome you in this new Lc room.<br>The purpose of this room is to regroup an "elite" of players from Members' room, the most actives and good ones, ready for kill all.</p>
<p>The ℄? symbol means to kill all random/friend (as the TAG also) according the big rule of no random policy of Lc.<br>So here in this room we just accept those who play with ℄? ONLY for kill everyone. Use ℄? outside of this room.</p>
<p>We will use another TAG than members/candidate's room.<br>As we will play more hardcore than members or candidate toward random/friend,</p>
<p>we can not mix with them on TAG (don't give this TAG outside of this room).</p>
<p>We won't play on same server than other Lc or EA, they should go out if we are in also (or not reach us).</p>
<p>It will be the more pro-playing we can have in Lc. We will have good fights all together.</p>
<p>Those who are not actives here will be "kicked" and stay in member room, but we will add back the player everytime when he become active again.</p>
