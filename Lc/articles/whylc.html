<p>℄ clan is&nbsp;a vision for us, we can never forget our <a href="https://jimboy3100.github.io/Lc/Lc.html?nav=History" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roots</a>.</p>
<p>It is because of our loyal members we stood still. We owe our prosperity to the people who believed in us, to these people who fighted for us, with us, or even to us, for the greater good.</p>
<p>These are the people who never betrayed our clan, who supported the idea even on the most severe situations. We can never forget these people, they are our real heroes.</p>
<p>What we accomplished, is a team work, in fact this is the actual group of friends (all we), that we support, but on an organised way.</p>
<p>REMEMBER: For any issue with players, talk to admins Hany or Dabous. We provide our skills and protection every day, but abandoning us / leaving main room, means traitor to us.</p>
<p>℄ clan remembers... on a few&nbsp;occasions we accepted players back to Lc after&nbsp;sincere repentance. But players who insulted, yelled, or betrayed&nbsp;us have no place in our clan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do have an ethical policy, we don't insult players of other clans but rather prove our superiority on gameplay. We avoid playing with fake names, with the exception of spy-to-spy policy, when enemy clan fakes our names.</p>
<p>We also establish fair games with&nbsp;clans that support fair gaming (not eating the small players). We also belong to the room "Game of Clans", supporting a more clan vs clan gameplay, rather than vs solo players. We provide our mod for free to everyone, and provide open source scripts to developers, but we respect the agario game everyone loves, by buying official skins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WE SUCCEEDED!&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the highest ethic of our clan, is the love of our clan, of our real friends. This means that we&nbsp;choose our Lc teammate over some other friend. Clan goes first...</p>
<p>✵ΕΛ✵ Clan stood by our side as brother on all our wars and ethics, this mean much for us.</p>
